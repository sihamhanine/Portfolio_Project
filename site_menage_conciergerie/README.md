# ASL Alphabet Recognition

This project is an AI-powered application built to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet gestures in real-time. Developed with a combination of Django, OpenCV, and Docker, it‚Äôs designed to be both accessible and efficient. The app captures hand gestures through a webcam, processes them using a pre-trained CNN model, and displays recognized letters on-screen.

## üìñ Introduction

My goal was to create an intuitive ASL alphabet recognition tool that could make American Sign Language more accessible to everyone. Although I started this project to push my machine learning skills, it soon became a meaningful way to contribute to accessible tech. This app interprets ASL alphabet gestures with decent real-time accuracy and responsiveness. While it's not perfect, I see this as a stepping stone toward a fully robust ASL recognition solution.

## üì¶ Installation

Clone this repository and use Docker Compose to get started.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cosmos510/asl-recognition.git
cd asl-recognition
docker compose up --build
```
After setup, access the application at [http://localhost](http://localhost).

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

1. **Launch the Application**: Open [http://localhost](http://localhost) in your browser.
2. **Start Recognition**: The application will access your webcam to capture gestures.
3. **Read the Output**: The system displays the detected ASL letters in real-time on the screen.

## üß† Technical Details

### 1. **Model Choice and Design**

- **Why CNN?**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are highly effective for image recognition tasks, making them ideal for ASL gesture detection. Given the complexity of ASL gestures, I chose a CNN model for its ability to efficiently extract features from images and accurately classify hand shapes.
- **Custom Model Development**: Rather than using a pre-trained model, I built the model from scratch. I trained it on a large dataset of ASL alphabet gestures to ensure the model could accurately recognize diverse hand shapes and gestures. This approach allowed me to create a highly specialized model tailored to the unique challenges of ASL recognition.

### 2. Data Pipeline and Preprocessing

- **Data Capture**: OpenCV captures frames from the webcam, which are then fed into the model for analysis.
- **Hand Landmark Extraction**: Each frame is processed to isolate hand landmarks, and I implemented a normalization step to ensure x and y coordinates are consistent. This preprocessing step significantly improved the model's accuracy by making gesture inputs more uniform.
- **Real-Time Processing Optimization**: To achieve low-latency, real-time performance, I optimized data flow from capture to prediction to minimize computational load.

## üìì Project Reflection

Creating this ASL recognition tool was both challenging and rewarding. Initially, it seemed straightforward, but real-time recognition required optimizing the model to reduce frame lag and improve accuracy. Normalizing hand landmarks was a critical breakthrough, allowing the model to handle different hand sizes and gestures consistently. Although the app performs well now, I‚Äôd like to keep improving it, especially the UI and extending its recognition capabilities beyond the alphabet.

### What I Learned
Real-time machine learning doesn‚Äôt always require powerful hardware; it‚Äôs about carefully optimizing each part of the algorithm. Working on this has deepened my interest in AI and accessibility tech.

### Future Goals
My next steps include refining the UI, optimizing the model further, and potentially expanding recognition to full ASL words and phrases.
